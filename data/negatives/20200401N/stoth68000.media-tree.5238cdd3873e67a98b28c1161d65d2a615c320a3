    sched: Prevent buddy interactions with throttled entities
    
    Buddies allow us to select "on-rq" entities without actually selecting them
    from a cfs_rq's rb_tree.  As a result we must ensure that throttled entities
    are not falsely nominated as buddies.  The fact that entities are dequeued
    within throttle_entity is not sufficient for clearing buddy status as the
    nomination may occur after throttling.
