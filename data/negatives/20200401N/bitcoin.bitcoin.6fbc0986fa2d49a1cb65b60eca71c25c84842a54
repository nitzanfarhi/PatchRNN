    gui: Show messages as text not html
    
    Currently, error messages (such as InitError) are displayed as-is, which
    means Qt does auto detection on the format.
    
    This means that it's possible to inject HTML from the command line
    though e.g. specifying a wallet name with HTML in it. This isn't
    a direct security risk because fetching content from internet is
    disabled (and as far as I know we never report strings received
    from the network this way). However, it can be confusing.
    
    So explicitly force the format as text.
