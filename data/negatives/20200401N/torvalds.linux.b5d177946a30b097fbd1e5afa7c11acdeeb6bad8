    drm/i915: Wait upon the last request seqno, rather than a future seqno

        drm/i915: Remove the per-ring write list
    
    the explicit flush was removed from i915_ring_idle(). However, we
    continued to wait upon the next seqno which now did not correspond to
    any request (except for the unusual condition of a failure to queue a
    request after execbuffer) and so would wait indefinitely.
    
    This has an important side-effect that i915_gpu_idle() does not cause
    the seqno to be incremented. This is vital if we are to be able to idle
    the GPU to handle seqno wraparound, as in subsequent patches.
