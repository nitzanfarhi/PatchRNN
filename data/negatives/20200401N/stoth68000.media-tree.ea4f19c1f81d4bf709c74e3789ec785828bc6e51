    net: sctp: spare unnecessary comparison in sctp_trans_elect_best
    
    When both transports are the same, we don't have to go down that
    road only to realize that we will return the very same transport.
    We are guaranteed that curr is always non-NULL. Therefore, just
    short-circuit this special case.
