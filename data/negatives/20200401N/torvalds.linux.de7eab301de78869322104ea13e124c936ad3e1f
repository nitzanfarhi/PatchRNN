    dma-direct: try reallocation with GFP_DMA32 if possible
    
    As the recent swiotlb bug revealed, we seem to have given up the direct
    DMA allocation too early and felt back to swiotlb allocation.  The reason
    is that swiotlb allocator expected that dma_direct_alloc() would try
    harder to get pages even below 64bit DMA mask with GFP_DMA32, but the
    function doesn't do that but only deals with GFP_DMA case.
    
    This patch adds a similar fallback reallocation with GFP_DMA32 as we've
    done with GFP_DMA.  The condition is that the coherent mask is smaller
    than 64bit (i.e. some address limitation), and neither GFP_DMA nor
    GFP_DMA32 is set beforehand.
