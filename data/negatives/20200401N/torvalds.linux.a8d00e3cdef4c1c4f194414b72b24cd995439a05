    libceph: SOCK_CLOSED is a flag, not a state
    
    The following commit changed it so SOCK_CLOSED bit was stored in
    a connection's new "flags" field rather than its "state" field.
    
        libceph: start separating connection flags from state
        commit 928443cd
    
    That bit is used in con_close_socket() to protect against setting an
    error message more than once in the socket event handler function.
    
    Unfortunately, the field being operated on in that function was not
    updated to be "flags" as it should have been.  This fixes that
    error.
