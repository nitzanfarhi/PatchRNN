    lockdep, bug: Exclude TAINT_OOT_MODULE from disabling lock debugging
    
    We do want to allow lock debugging for GPL-compatible modules
    that are not (yet) built in-tree.  This was disabled as a
    side-effect of commit 2449b8ba0745327c5fa49a8d9acffe03b2eded69
    ('module,bug: Add TAINT_OOT_MODULE flag for modules not built
    in-tree').  Lock debug warnings now include taint flags, so
    kernel developers should still be able to deflect warnings
    caused by out-of-tree modules.
    
    The TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE flag for non-GPL-compatible modules
    will still disable lock debugging.
