    ALSA: timer: Sync timer deletion at closing the system timer
    
    ALSA timer core framework has no sync point at stopping because it's
    called inside the spinlock.  Thus we need a sync point at close for
    avoiding the stray timer task.  This is simply done by implementing
    the close callback just calling del_timer_sync().  (It's harmless to
    call it unconditionally, as the core timer itself cares of the already
    deleted timer instance.)
