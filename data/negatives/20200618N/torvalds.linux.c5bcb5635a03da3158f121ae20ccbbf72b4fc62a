    [PATCH] x86: Use RDTSCP for synchronous get_cycles if possible
    
    RDTSCP is already synchronous and doesn't need an explicit CPUID.
    This is a little faster and more importantly avoids VMEXITs on Hypervisors.
    
    Original patch from Joerg Roedel, but reworked by AK
    Also includes miscompilation fix by Eric Biederman
