    perf tools: Disallow PMU events intel_pt and intel_bts until there is support
    
    Disallow PMU events intel_pt and intel_bts until the tools support them.
    
    By default any PMU is selectable as an event but until the tools have
    intel_pt and intel_bts support using them would result in no data being
    recorded without any indication as to why.
    
    Before the change:
    
        $ perf record -e intel_bts// sleep 1
        [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
        [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.008 MB perf.data ]
        $ perf report --stdio
        Error:
        The perf.data file has no samples!
    
    After the change:
    
        $ perf record -e intel_bts// sleep 1
        invalid or unsupported event: 'intel_bts//'
        Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events
