    drm/msm/mdp5: Create only as many CRTCs as we need
    
    We currently create CRTCs equaling to the # of Layer Mixer blocks we
    have on the MDP5 HW. This number is generally more than the # of encoders
    (INTFs) we have in the MDSS HW. The number of encoders connected to
    displays on the platform (as described by DT) would be even lesser.
    
    Create only N drm_crtcs, where N is the number of drm_encoders
    successfully registered. To do this, we call modeset_init_intf() before
    we init the drm_crtcs and drm_planes.
    
    Because of this change, setting encoder->possible_crtcs needs to be moved
    from construct_encoder() to a later point when we know how many CRTCs we
    have.
