    dm mpath: support discard
    
    Enable discard support in the DM multipath target.
    
    This discard support depends on a few discard-specific fixes to the
    block layer's request stacking driver methods.
    
    Discard requests are optional so don't allow a failed discard to trigger
    path failures.  If there is a real problem with a given path the
    barriers associated with the discard (either before or after the
    discard) will cause path failure.  That said, unconditionally passing
    discard failures up the stack is not ideal.  This must be fixed once DM
    has more information about the nature of the underlying storage failure.
