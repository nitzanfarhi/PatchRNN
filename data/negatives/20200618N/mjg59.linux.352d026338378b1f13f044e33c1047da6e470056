    USB: don't register endpoints for interfaces that are going away
    
    This patch (as1155) fixes a bug in usbcore.  When interfaces are
    deleted, either because the device was disconnected or because of a
    configuration change, the extra attribute files and child endpoint
    devices may get left behind.  This is because the core removes them
    before calling device_del().  But during device_del(), after the
    driver is unbound the core will reinstall altsetting 0 and recreate
    those extra attributes and children.
    
    The patch prevents this by adding a flag to record when the interface
    is in the midst of being unregistered.  When the flag is set, the
    attribute files and child devices will not be created.
