    bnxt_en: Need to unconditionally shut down RoCE in bnxt_shutdown
    
    The current 'bnxt_shutdown' implementation only invokes
    'bnxt_ulp_shutdown' to shut down RoCE in the case when the system is in
    the path of power off (SYSTEM_POWER_OFF). While this may work in most
    cases, it does not work in the smart NIC case, when Linux 'reboot'
    command is initiated from the Linux that runs on the ARM cores of the
    NIC card. In this particular case, Linux 'reboot' results in a system
    'L3' level reset where the entire ARM and associated subsystems are
    being reset, but at the same time, Nitro core is being kept in sane state
    (to allow external PCIe connected servers to continue to work). Without
    properly shutting down RoCE and freeing all associated resources, it
    results in the ARM core to hang immediately after the 'reboot'
    
    By always invoking 'bnxt_ulp_shutdown' in 'bnxt_shutdown', it fixes the
    above issue
