    bonding: permit enslaving interfaces without set_mac support
    
    Currently we exit if the slave isn't the first slave, doesn't support mac
    address setting and fail_over_mac isn't FOM_ACTIVE. It's wrong because we
    only require ndo_set_mac_address in case bonding is in active-backup mode
    and FOM isn't FOM_ACTIVE.
    
    To fix this - only exit with an error if we're in a/b mode and have
    fail_over_mac != FOM_ACTIVE.
    
    Also, maintain current behaviour on the first slave (forcibly change fom to
    FOM_ACTIVE) to not break anyone's configuration.
