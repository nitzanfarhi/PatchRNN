    ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid invalid COEFs for ALC271X
    
    We've seen often problems after suspend/resume on Acer Aspire One
    AO725 with ALC271X codec as reported in kernel bugzilla, and it turned
    out that some COEFs doesn't work and triggers the codec communication
    stall.
    
    Since these magic COEF setups are specific to ALC269VB for some PLL
    configurations, the machine works even without these manual
    adjustment.  So, let's simply avoid applying them for ALC271X.
