    cxl: Disable SPAP register when freeing SPA
    
    When we deactivate the AFU directed mode we free the scheduled process
    area, but did not clear the register in the hardware that has a pointer
    to it.
    
    This should be fine since we will have already cleared out every context
    and we won't do anything that would cause the hardware to access it
    until after we have allocated a new one, but just to be safe this patch
    clears out the register when we free the page.
