    Fix invalid Coverity error
    
    This should make a Coverity error go away. The error is being
      generated in error by Coverity, but it isn't smart enough to
      determine the range of values possible from a modulo function
      (if the input is negative, its results can't be less than the
      negative of the divisor). This should clear about a dozen errors.
