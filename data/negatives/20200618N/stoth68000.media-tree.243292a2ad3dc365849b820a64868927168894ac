    xhci: report U3 when link is in resume state
    
    xhci_hub_report_usb3_link_state() returns pls as U0 when the link
    is in resume state, and this causes usb core to think the link is in
    U0 while actually it's in resume state. When usb core transfers
    control request on the link, it fails with TRB error as the link
    is not ready for transfer.
    
    To fix the issue, report U3 when the link is in resume state, thus
    usb core knows the link it's not ready for transfer.
