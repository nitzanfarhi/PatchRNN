    thinkpad-acpi: document HKEY event 3006
    
    Event 0x3006 is used to help power management of the ODD in the
    UltraBay.  The EC generates this event when the ODD eject button is
    pressed (even if the bay is powered down).
    
    Normally, Linux doesn't need this as we keep the SATA link powered
    up (which wastes power).  The EC powers up the bay by itself when the
    ODD eject button is pressed, and the SATA PHY reports the hotplug.
    
    However, we could also power that SATA link down (and for that matter,
    also power down the Ultrabay) if the ODD is left idle for a while with
    no disk inside, and use event 0x3006 to know when we need that SATA link
    powered back up.
    
    For now, just stop asking for more information when event 0x3006 is
    seen, there is no point in pestering users about it anymore.
