    lib: rhashtable: Correct self-assignment in rhashtable.c
    
    In file lib/rhashtable.c line 777, skip variable is assigned to
    itself. The following error was observed:
    
    lib/rhashtable.c:777:41: warning: explicitly assigning value of
    variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign] error, forbidden
    warning: rhashtable.c:777
    This error was found when compiling with Clang 6.0. Change it to iter->skip.
