    mm: hugetlbfs: skip shared VMAs when unmapping private pages to satisfy a fault
    
    SunDong reported the following on
    
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103841
    
            I think I find a linux bug, I have the test cases is constructed. I
            can stable recurring problems in fedora22(4.0.4) kernel version,
            arch for x86_64.  I construct transparent huge page, when the parent
            and child process with MAP_SHARE, MAP_PRIVATE way to access the same
            huge page area, it has the opportunity to lead to huge page copy on
            write failure, and then it will munmap the child corresponding mmap
            area, but then the child mmap area with VM_MAYSHARE attributes, child
            process munmap this area can trigger VM_BUG_ON in set_vma_resv_flags
            functions (vma - > vm_flags & VM_MAYSHARE).
    
    There were a number of problems with the report (e.g.  it's hugetlbfs that
    triggers this, not transparent huge pages) but it was fundamentally
    correct in that a VM_BUG_ON in set_vma_resv_flags() can be triggered that
    looks like this
    
             vma ffff8804651fd0d0 start 00007fc474e00000 end 00007fc475e00000
             next ffff8804651fd018 prev ffff8804651fd188 mm ffff88046b1b1800
             prot 8000000000000027 anon_vma           (null) vm_ops ffffffff8182a7a0
             pgoff 0 file ffff88106bdb9800 private_data           (null)
             flags: 0x84400fb(read|write|shared|mayread|maywrite|mayexec|mayshare|dontexpand|hugetlb)
             ------------

    The VM_BUG_ON is correct because private and shared mappings have
    different reservation accounting but the warning clearly shows that the
    VMA is shared.
    
    When a private COW fails to allocate a new page then only the process
    that created the VMA gets the page -- all the children unmap the page.
    If the children access that data in the future then they get killed.
    
    The problem is that the same file is mapped shared and private.  During
    the COW, the allocation fails, the VMAs are traversed to unmap the other
    private pages but a shared VMA is found and the bug is triggered.  This
    patch identifies such VMAs and skips them.
