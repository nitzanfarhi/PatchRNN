+        ../../../components/mysql_server/component_mysql_server.a(server_component.cc.o):%server_component.cc:imp_...: error: undefined reference to '..._impl::...'
+
+    In such case you should add a new `%init()` method (it can be dummy/empty) to
+    your source file that contains service methods implementations and a call
+    to that method somewhere in mysqld.cc. This will help GCC not to optimize
+    the required object file out of linkage. Take `mysql_string_services_init()`
+    as an example. This applies only to service implementations added to the
+    server component.
