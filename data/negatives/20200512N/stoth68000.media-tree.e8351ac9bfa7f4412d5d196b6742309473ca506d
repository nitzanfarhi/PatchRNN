    mm/rmap: use rmap_walk() in try_to_munlock()
    
    Now, we have an infrastructure in rmap_walk() to handle difference from
    variants of rmap traversing functions.
    
    So, just use it in try_to_munlock().
    
    In this patch, I change following things.
    
    1. remove some variants of rmap traversing functions.
            cf> try_to_unmap_ksm, try_to_unmap_anon, try_to_unmap_file
    2. mechanical change to use rmap_walk() in try_to_munlock().
    3. copy and paste comments.
