    efi-boot-generator: set automount expire for /boot
    
    This should make the Linux vfat handling less fragile, by unmounting
    the idle mount and causing to sync the entire file system to disk.
    
    On my machines, The FAT file system at /boot regularly gets corrupted
    with unclean shutdowns, rendering the machines unbootable. Either the
    VFS write-back behaviour or the vfat driver itself is just not reliable
    enough to be/stay mounted at every bootup.
    
    Because of that, the automount expiry was on top of my personal
    wish list. Thanks a lot Michael!
