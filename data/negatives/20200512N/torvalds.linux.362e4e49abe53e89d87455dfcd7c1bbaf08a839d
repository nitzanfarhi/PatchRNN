    ALSA: usb-audio - clear chip->probing on error exit
    
    The Terratec Aureon 5.1 USB sound card support is broken since kernel
    2.6.39.
    2.6.39 introduced power management support for USB sound cards that added
    a probing flag in struct snd_usb_audio.
    
    During the probe of the card it gives following error message :
    
    usb 7-2: new full speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
    cannot find UAC_HEADER
    snd-usb-audio: probe of 7-2:1.3 failed with error -5
    input: USB Audio as
    /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb7/7-2/7-2:1.3/input/input6
    generic-usb 0003:0CCD:0028.0001: input: USB HID v1.00 Device [USB Audio]
    on usb-0000:00:1d.1-2/input3
    
    I can not comment about that "cannot find UAC_HEADER" error, but until
    2.6.38 the card worked anyway.
    With 2.6.39 chip->probing remains 1 on error exit, and any later ioctl
    stops in snd_usb_autoresume with -ENODEV.
