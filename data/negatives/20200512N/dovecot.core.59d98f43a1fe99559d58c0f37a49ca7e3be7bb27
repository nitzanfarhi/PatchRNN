    master: Don't throttle services that are already being destroyed
    
    If process couldn't be created, because the service_list is already being
    destroyed (e.g. due to reload), also don't enable unnecessary throttling
    for the service.
    
    Hopefully fixes these random errors that are logged alone:
    master: Error: service(...): command startup failed, throttling for 2 secs
