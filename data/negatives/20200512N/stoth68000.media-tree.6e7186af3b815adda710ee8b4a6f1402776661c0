    drm/i915: Make aliasing a 2nd class VM
    
    There is a good debate to be had about how best to fit the aliasing
    PPGTT into the code. However, as it stands right now, getting aliasing
    PPGTT bindings is a hack, and done through implicit arguments. To make
    this absolutely clear, WARN and return an error if a driver writer tries
    to do something they shouldn't.
    
    I have no issue with an eventual revert of this patch. It makes sense
    for what we have today.
