    ALSA: ctxfi: Swapped SURROUND-SIDE channels on emu20k2
    
    On Soundblaster X-FI Titanium with emu20k2 the SIDE and SURROUND
    channels were swapped and wrong.
    I double checked it with connector colors and creative soundblaster
    windows drivers.
    
    So I swapped them to the true order.
    Now "speaker-test -c6" and "speaker-test -c8" are working fine.
