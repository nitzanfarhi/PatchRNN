    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: handle HKEY event 6030
    
    HKEY event 0x6030 is a helper for Lenovo's Advanced Thermal Management
    Windows driver, which is, of course, completely undocumented.
    
    Silence any warnings about it being an unknown alarm, and report it
    unmodified for userspace.
