    ACPI / bus: Leave modalias empty for devices which are not present
    
    Most Bay and Cherry Trail devices use a generic DSDT with all possible
    peripheral devices present in the DSDT, with their _STA returning 0x00 or
    0x0f based on AML variables which describe what is actually present on
    the board.
    
    Since ACPI device objects with a 0x00 status (not present) still get an
    entry under /sys/bus/acpi/devices, and those entry had an acpi:PNPID
    modalias, userspace would end up loading modules for non present hardware.
    
    This commit fixes this by leaving the modalias empty for non present
    devices. This results in 10 modules less being loaded with a generic
    distro kernel config on my Cherry Trail test-device (a GPD pocket).
