    ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Don't sync first two registers from register cache
    
    There is no need to sync first two registers from cache to hw after a reset.
    First one is used to select page for register access and this driver is
    normally accessing page 0 only. Second one does a software reset which is
    obviously unneeded after hardware or previous software reset command.
