commit 6b54bc9f78910a7aaa2d291c4e1675a3bdb55902

    The compile caught a type mismatch for vsnprintf, this change fixes it, but
    not in a typesafe way (I don't see typesafe extensions for *printf...).
    Since the two arguents are now 8 bit, putting them in a "int" should always
    work (unless someone wants to go back to 4 bit computers...).
