    brcm80211: smac: set interface down on reset
    
    This change marks interface as down on reset, otherwise the driver can't
    reinitialize itself properly.
    
    Without the change a transient problem turns out to be critical and leads
    to inavailability to reset the driver without brcmsmac module unload/load
    cycle:
    
        ieee80211 phy0: wl0: PSM microcode watchdog fired at 5993 (seconds). Resetting.
        brcms_c_dpc : PSM Watchdog, chipid 0xa8d9, chiprev 0x1
        ieee80211 phy0: wl0: fatal error, reinitializing
        ieee80211 phy0: Hardware restart was requested
        ieee80211 phy0: brcms_ops_start: brcms_up() returned -19
