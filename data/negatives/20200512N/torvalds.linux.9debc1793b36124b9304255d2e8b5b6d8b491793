    USB: EHCI: add a name for the platform-private field
    
    This patch (as1642) adds an ehci->priv field for private use by EHCI
    platform drivers.  The space was provided some time ago, but it didn't
    have a name.
    
    Until now none of the platform drivers has used this private space,
    but that's about to change in the next patch of this series.
