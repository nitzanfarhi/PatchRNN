    greybus: tracing: assign "parent" id first
    
    Most abstractions to be traced will have a sort of "parent" object
    it is associated with, and an identifier for that parent is stored
    with the as trace event data.  For example, the parent of a message
    is the operation it's a part of, and the parent of an operation is
    the connection it uses.
    
    We'll arrange to define that parent id first in all events.  Most
    abstractions already do this.  Move an interface's module id so it's
    defined and assigned first.  The message traces are going to be
    changed soon, so leave that one alone.
