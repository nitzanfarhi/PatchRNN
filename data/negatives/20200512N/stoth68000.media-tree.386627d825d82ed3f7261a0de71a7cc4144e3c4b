    ARM: KVM: Gracefully handle hyp-stubs being restored from under our feet
    
    Should kvm_reboot() be invoked while guest is running, an IPI
    wil be issued, forcing the guest to exit and HYP being reset to
    the stubs. We will then try to reenter the guest, only to get
    an error (HVC_STUB_ERR).
    
    This patch allows this case to be gracefully handled by exiting
    the run loop.
