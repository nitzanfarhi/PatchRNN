    ARM: 8631/1: clkdev: Detect errors in clk_hw_register_clkdev() for mass registration
    
    Unlike clk_register_clkdev(), clk_hw_register_clkdev() doesn't check for
    passed error objects from a previous registration call. Hence the caller
    of clk_hw_register_*() has to check for errors before calling
    clk_hw_register_clkdev*().
    
    Make clk_hw_register_clkdev() more similar to clk_register_clkdev() by
    adding this error check, removing the burden from callers that do mass
    registration.
