    drm/i915: copy staged scaler state from drm state to crtc->config.
    
    This is required for commit to perform as per staged assignment
    of scalers until atomic crtc commit function is available.
    
    As a place holder doing this copy from intel_atomic_commit for
    scaling to operate correctly.
