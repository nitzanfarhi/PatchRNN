    ARM: OMAP1: omap h2 regression fix
    
    H2 and H3 were broken on by e27a93a944a5ba6a0112750c8243abba86d56e94,
    which removed declarations for their tps6501x chips.  This resolves
    that issue for the H2.  (Note that this patch *also* broke the isp1301
    support on H2; it presumed a not-yet-merged new-style I2c driver.)
