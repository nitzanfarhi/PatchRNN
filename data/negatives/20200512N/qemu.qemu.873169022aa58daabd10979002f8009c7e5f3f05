    hw/intc/arm_gic: Fix NVIC assertion failure
    
    Commit 40d225009ef accidentally changed the behaviour of
    gic_acknowledge_irq() for the NVIC. The NVIC doesn't have SGIs,
    so this meant we hit an assertion:
      gic_acknowledge_irq: Assertion `s->sgi_pending[irq][cpu] != 0' failed.
    
    Return NVIC acknowledge-irq to its previous behaviour, like 11MPCore.
