    Drivers: hv: vss: run only on supported host versions
    
    The Backup integration service on WS2012 has appearently trouble to
    negotiate with a guest which does not support the provided util version.
    Currently the VSS driver supports only version 5/0. A WS2012 offers only
    version 1/x and 3/x, and vmbus_prep_negotiate_resp correctly returns an
    empty icframe_vercnt/icmsg_vercnt. But the host ignores that and
    continues to send ICMSGTYPE_NEGOTIATE messages. The result are weird
    errors during boot and general misbehaviour.
    
    Check the Windows version to work around the host bug, skip hv_vss_init
    on WS2012 and older.
