    Btrfs: don't do async reclaim during log replay
    
    Trying to reproduce a log enospc bug I hit a panic in the async reclaim code
    during log replay.  This is because we use fs_info->fs_root as our root for
    shrinking and such.  Technically we can use whatever root we want, but let's
    just not allow async reclaim while we're doing log replay.  Thanks,
