    Drivers: hv: balloon: Make the balloon driver not unloadable
    
    The balloon driver is stateful. For instance, it needs to keep track of pages
    that have been ballooned out to properly post pressure reports. This state cannot
    be re-constructed if the driver were to be unloaded and subsequently loaded.
    Furthermore, as we support memory hot-add as part of this driver, this driver becomes
    even more stateful and this state cannot be re-created. Make the balloon driver
    unloadable to deal with this issue.
