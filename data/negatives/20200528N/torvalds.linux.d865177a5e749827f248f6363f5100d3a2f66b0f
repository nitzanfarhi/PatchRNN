    Btrfs: clear uptodate flags of pages in sys_array eb
    
    We set uptodate flag to pages in the temporary sys_array eb,
    but do not clear the flag after free eb.  As the special
    btree inode may still hold a reference on those pages, the
    uptodate flag can remain alive in them.
    
    If btrfs_super_chunk_root has been intentionally changed to the
    offset of this sys_array eb, reading chunk_root will read content
    of sys_array and it will skip our beautiful checks in
    btree_readpage_end_io_hook() because of
    "pages of eb are uptodate => eb is uptodate"
    
    This adds the 'clear uptodate' part to force it to read from disk.
