    Revert "mmc: enable runtime PM by default"
    
    When SDIO runtime PM was originally introduced, we immediately faced
    two regressions with two different chipsets, and in response decided
    not to enable it by default.
    
    With the recent work on the 8686 we hoped we found all the gotchas,
    so 08da834 did make sense (at least experimentally).
    
    Unfortunately we now see that some setups out there still refuse to
    work when SDIO runtime PM is enabled by default (see
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg11161.html), and obviously
    we can't live with these kind of regressions.
    
    This reverts commit 08da834a24312157f512224691ad1fddd11c1073.
