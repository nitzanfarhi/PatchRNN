    [PATCH] cpufreq_conservative: alter default responsiveness
    
    The sensible approach to making conservative less responsive than ondemand :)
    As mentioned in patch [1/4].  We do not want conservative to shoot through
    all the frequencies, its point (by default) is to slowly move through them.
    
    By default its ten times less responsive.
