    IPv6 forwarding setting should be 1 or 2
    
    A value of 2 means that the kernel has enabled IP forwarding and that it
    also will perform router solicitation. Whilst this kind of setup may
    appear unusual; it is reasonably widely used especially for consumer
    devices which will have a WAN link (e.g. ppp, etc.)
