    phy: ti-pipe3: Fix suspend/resume and module reload
    
    Due to Errata i783, SATA breaks if its DPLL is idled. The recommeded
    workaround to issue a softreset to the SATA controller doesn't seem to
    work. Here we just prevent SATA DPLL from Idling and hence avoid
    the issue altogether.
