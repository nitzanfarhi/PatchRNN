    drm/i915: mark a newly-created GEM object dirty when filled with data
    
    When creating a new (pageable) GEM object and filling it with data, we
    must mark it as 'dirty', i.e. backing store is out-of-date w.r.t. the
    newly-written content. This ensures that if the object is evicted under
    memory pressure, its pages in the pagecache will be written to backing
    store rather than discarded.
    
    Based on an original version by Alex Dai.
