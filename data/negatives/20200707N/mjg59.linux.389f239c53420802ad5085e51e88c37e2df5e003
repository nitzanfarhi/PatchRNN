    btrfs: make sure we stay inside the bvec during __btrfs_lookup_bio_sums
    
    Commit c40a3d38aff4e1c (Btrfs: Compute and look up csums based on
    sectorsized blocks) changes around how we walk the bios while looking up
    crcs.  There's an inner loop that is jumping to the next bvec based on
    sectors and before it derefs the next bvec, it needs to make sure we're
    still in the bio.
    
    In this case, the outer loop would have decided to stop moving forward
    too, and the bvec deref is never actually used for anything.  But
    CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC catches it because we're outside our bio.
