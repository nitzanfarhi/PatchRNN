    cifs: always do is_path_accessible check in cifs_mount
    
    Currently, we skip doing the is_path_accessible check in cifs_mount if
    there is no prefixpath. I have a report of at least one server however
    that allows a TREE_CONNECT to a share that has a DFS referral at its
    root. The reporter in this case was using a UNC that had no prefixpath,
    so the is_path_accessible check was not triggered and the box later hit
    a BUG() because we were chasing a DFS referral on the root dentry for
    the mount.
    
    This patch fixes this by removing the check for a zero-length
    prefixpath.  That should make the is_path_accessible check be done in
    this situation and should allow the client to chase the DFS referral at
    mount time instead.
