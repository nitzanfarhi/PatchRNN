    Make sure the desktop window is transparent
    
    The code was just assuming that setting an rgba visual is enough
    to make a window see-through. This assumption was invalidated
    by the GTK+ csd work that happened this cycle. We can fix this
    by explicitly setting the background color of the desktop
    window.
