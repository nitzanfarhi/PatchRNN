    staging: comedi: disallow COMEDI_DEVCONFIG on non-board minors
    
    Comedi has two sorts of minor devices:
    (a) normal board minor devices in the range 0 to
    COMEDI_NUM_BOARD_MINORS-1 inclusive; and
    (b) special subdevice minor devices in the range COMEDI_NUM_BOARD_MINORS
    upwards that are used to open the same underlying comedi device as the
    normal board minor devices, but with non-default read and write
    subdevices for asynchronous commands.
    
    The special subdevice minor devices get created when a board supporting
    asynchronous commands is attached to a normal board minor device, and
    destroyed when the board is detached from the normal board minor device.
    One way to attach or detach a board is by using the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG
    ioctl.  This should only be used on normal board minors as the special
    subdevice minors are too ephemeral.  In particular, the change
    introduced in commit 7d3135af399e92cf4c9bbc5f86b6c140aab3b88c ("staging:
    comedi: prevent auto-unconfig of manually configured devices") breaks
    horribly for special subdevice minor devices.
    
    Since there's no legitimate use for the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl on a
    special subdevice minor device node, disallow it and return -ENOTTY.
