    thp: update futex compound knowledge
    
    Futex code is smarter than most other gup_fast O_DIRECT code and knows
    about the compound internals.  However now doing a put_page(head_page)
    will not release the pin on the tail page taken by gup-fast, leading to
    all sort of refcounting bugchecks.  Getting a stable head_page is a little
    tricky.
    
    page_head = page is there because if this is not a tail page it's also the
    page_head.  Only in case this is a tail page, compound_head is called,
    otherwise it's guaranteed unnecessary.  And if it's a tail page
    compound_head has to run atomically inside irq disabled section
    __get_user_pages_fast before returning.  Otherwise ->first_page won't be a
    stable pointer.
    
    Disableing irq before __get_user_page_fast and releasing irq after running
    compound_head is needed because if __get_user_page_fast returns == 1, it
    means the huge pmd is established and cannot go away from under us.
    pmdp_splitting_flush_notify in __split_huge_page_splitting will have to
    wait for local_irq_enable before the IPI delivery can return.  This means
    __split_huge_page_refcount can't be running from under us, and in turn
    when we run compound_head(page) we're not reading a dangling pointer from
    tailpage->first_page.  Then after we get to stable head page, we are
    always safe to call compound_lock and after taking the compound lock on
    head page we can finally re-check if the page returned by gup-fast is
    still a tail page.  in which case we're set and we didn't need to split
    the hugepage in order to take a futex on it.
