    inotify: fix coalesce duplicate events into a single event in special case
    
    If we do rename a dir entry, like this:
    
      rename("/tmp/ino7UrgoJ.rename1", "/tmp/ino7UrgoJ.rename2")
      rename("/tmp/ino7UrgoJ.rename2", "/tmp/ino7UrgoJ")
    
    The duplicate events should be coalesced into a single event. But those two
    events do not be coalesced into a single event, due to some bad check in
    event_compare(). It can not match the two NULL inodes as the same event.
