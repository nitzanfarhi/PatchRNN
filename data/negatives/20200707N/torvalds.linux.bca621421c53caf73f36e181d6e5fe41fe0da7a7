    HID: hid-magicmouse: Magic Trackpad has 1 button, not 2
    
    hid-magicmouse was advertising the Apple Magic Trackpad as having 2
    buttons (left and right) when it actually only has 1 button.
    
    Advertising multiple buttons makes Xorg disable all button 2 and 3
    emulation (using multi-finger clicks). So Xorg users don't get working
    right/middle-click emulation out of the box.
    
    This patch makes hid-magicmouse correctly only report one real button
    for Magic Trackpad, which in turn makes Xorg enable multi-finger click
    support to emulate right/middle buttons.
