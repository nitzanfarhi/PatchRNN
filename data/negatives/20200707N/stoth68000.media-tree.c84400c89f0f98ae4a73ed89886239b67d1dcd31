    md-cluster/bitmap: unplug bitmap to sync dirty pages to disk
    
    This patch is doing two distinct but related things.
    
    1. It adds bitmap_unplug() for the main bitmap (mddev->bitmap).  As bit
    have been set, BITMAP_PAGE_DIRTY is set so bitmap_deamon_work() will
    not write those pages out in its regular scans, only bitmap_unplug()
    will.  If there are no writes to the array, bitmap_unplug() won't be
    called, so we need to call it explicitly here.
    
    2. bitmap_write_all() is a bit of a confusing interface as it doesn't
    actually write anything.  The current code for writing "bitmap" works
    but this change makes it a bit clearer.
