    libblkid/minix: Match minix superblock types
    
    All of the types in the minix super block are unsigned but in
    probe_minix they were being treated as signed. This would cause some of
    the extra sanity checks to pass on a non minix device. The types were
    updated to match the return types of the helper functions in
    disk-utils/minix_programs.h
    
    This can be checked by creating a swap partition with one of these UUIDs
    35f1f264-2468-471a-bc85-acc9f4bc04a3
    35f1f264-6824-471a-bc85-acc9f4bc04a3
    35f1f264-2478-471a-bc85-acc9f4bc04a3
    35f1f264-7824-471a-bc85-acc9f4bc04a3
    
    Prior to this change they would all be considered minix and swap by
    blkid.
