    cpufreq: update user_policy.* on success
    
    'user_policy' caches properties of a policy that are set by userspace.
    And these must be updated only if cpufreq core was successful in
    updating them based on request from user space.
    
    In store_scaling_governor(), we are updating user_policy.policy and
    user_policy.governor even if cpufreq_set_policy() failed. That's
    incorrect.
    
    Fix this by updating user_policy.* only if we were successful in
    updating the properties.
