    drm/atomic: Wait for vblank whenever a plane is added to state.
    
    There's 2 reasons for doing a vblank wait:
    - To fulfill uabi expectations, but the legacy ioctls are ill-defined
      enough that we really only need this when we do send out an event.
    - To make sure we don't tear down mappings before the scanout engine
      stops accessing it.
    
    The later is problematic with the current code since e.g. rotation
    might need a different mapping than normal orientation. And rotation
    is a plane property, and not on the fb. Hence we need to remove this
    optimization.
