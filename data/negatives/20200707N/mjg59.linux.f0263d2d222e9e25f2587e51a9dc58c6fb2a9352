    mm: highmem: export kmap_to_page for modules
    
    Some virtio device drivers (9p) need to translate high virtual addresses
    to physical addresses, which are inserted into the virtqueue for
    processing by userspace.
    
    This patch exports the kmap_to_page symbol, so that the affected drivers
    can be compiled as modules.
