    drm/i915: synchronize_irq() before turning off disp2d power well on VLV/CHV
    
    After we've told the irq code we don't want to handle display irqs
    anymore, we must make sure any display irq handling already
    kicked off has finished before we actually turn off the power well.
    
    I wouldn't expect PIPESTAT based interrupts to occur anymore since
    vblanks/page flips/gmbus/etc should all be quiescent at this point.
    But at least hotplug interrupts could still occur. Hotplug
    interrupts may also kick off the workqueue based hotplug processing,
    but that code should take the required power domain references
    itself, so there shouldn't be any need to synchronize with the
    hotplug processing from the power well code.
