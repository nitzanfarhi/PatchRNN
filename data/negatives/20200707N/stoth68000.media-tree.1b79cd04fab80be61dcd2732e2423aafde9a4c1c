    nfsd: fix vm overcommit crash fix #2
    
    The previous patch from Alan Cox ("nfsd: fix vm overcommit crash",
    commit 731572d39fcd3498702eda4600db4c43d51e0b26) fixed the problem where
    knfsd crashes on exported shmemfs objects and strict overcommit is set.
    
    But the patch forgot supporting the case when CONFIG_SECURITY is
    disabled.
    
    This patch copies a part of his fix which is mainly for detecting a bug
    earlier.
