    [NETFILTER]: Fix DHCP + MASQUERADE problem
    
    In 2.6.13-rcX the MASQUERADE target was changed not to exclude local
    packets for better source address consistency. This breaks DHCP clients
    using UDP sockets when the DHCP requests are caught by a MASQUERADE rule
    because the MASQUERADE target drops packets when no address is configured
    on the outgoing interface. This patch makes it ignore packets with a
    source address of 0.
    
    Thanks to Rusty for this suggestion.
