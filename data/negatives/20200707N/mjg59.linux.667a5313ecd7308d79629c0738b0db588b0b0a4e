    md: Don't truncate size at 4TB for RAID0 and Linear
    
    commit 27a7b260f71439c40546b43588448faac01adb93
       md: Fix handling for devices from 2TB to 4TB in 0.90 metadata.
    
    changed 0.90 metadata handling to truncated size to 4TB as that is
    all that 0.90 can record.
    However for RAID0 and Linear, 0.90 doesn't need to record the size, so
    this truncation is not needed and causes working arrays to become too small.
    
    So avoid the truncation for RAID0 and Linear
    
    This bug was introduced in 3.1 and is suitable for any stable kernels
    from then onwards.
    As the offending commit was tagged for 'stable', any stable kernel
    that it was applied to should also get this patch.  That includes
    at least 2.6.32, 2.6.33 and 3.0. (Thanks to Ben Hutchings for
    providing that list).
