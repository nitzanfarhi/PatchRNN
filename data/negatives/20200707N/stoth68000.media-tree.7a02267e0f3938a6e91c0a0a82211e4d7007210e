    ahci: let users know that Promise PDC42819 support is limited to SATA devices
    
    ahci can drive the Promise PDC42819, but obviously it can only use SATA
    disks connected to this controller. The controller can actually support
    SAS disks as well, but we only know how to use it in it's AHCI mode.
    
    Add a message to let users know that because ahci is driving their chip
    they can only use the SATA disks connected to this controller.
