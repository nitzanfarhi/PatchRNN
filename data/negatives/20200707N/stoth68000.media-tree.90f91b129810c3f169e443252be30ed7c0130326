    b43: fix support for 14e4:4321 PCI dev with BCM4321 chipset
    
    It seems Broadcom released two devices with conflicting device id. There
    are for sure 14e4:4321 PCI devices with BCM4321 (N-PHY) chipset, they
    can be found in routers, e.g. Netgear WNR834Bv2. However, according to
    Broadcom public sources 0x4321 is also used for 5 GHz BCM4306 (G-PHY).
    It's unsure if they meant PCI device id, or "virtual" id (from SPROM).
    To distinguish these devices lets check PHY type (G vs. N).
