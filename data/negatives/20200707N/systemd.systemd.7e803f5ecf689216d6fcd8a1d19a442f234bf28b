    core: fix assertion failure in checking a transaction with a JOB_NOP
    
    Several functions called from transaction_activate() need to correctly
    handle the case where a JOB_NOP job is being checked against a unit's
    pending job. The assumption that JOB_NOP never merges with other job
    types was correct, but since the job_type_is_*() functions are
    implemented using the merge lookup, they need to special-case JOB_NOP
    to avoid hitting assertion failures.
