    USB: prevent buggy hubs from crashing the USB stack
    
    If anyone comes across a high-speed hub that (by mistake or by design)
    claims to have no Transaction Translators, plugging a full- or
    low-speed device into it will cause the USB stack to crash.  This
    patch (as1446) prevents the problem by ignoring such devices, since
    the kernel has no way to communicate with them.
