    Revert "drm/i915: Do not allow buffers at offset 0"
    
    This reverts commit 4fe9adbc36097317864bfec3c32047da7c45a2fa.
    
    The patch completely lacks a detailed explanation of what exactly
    blows up and how, so is insufficiently justified as a band-aid.
    
    Otoh the justification as a safety measure against userspace botching
    up relocations is also fairly weak: If we want real project we need to
    at least make the gab big enough that the gpu doesn't scribble over
    more important stuff. With 4k screens that would be 32MB.
    
    Also I think this would be much better in conjunction with a (debug)
    switch to disable our use of the scratch page.
    
    Hence revert this.
