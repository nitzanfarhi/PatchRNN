    blkcg: don't create "io.stat" on the root cgroup
    
    The stat files on the root cgroup shows stats for the whole system and
    usually don't contain any information which isn't available through
    the usual system monitoring mechanisms.  Some controllers skip
    collecting these duplicate stats to optimize cases where cgroup isn't
    used and later try to emulate the result on demand.
    
    This leads to complexities and subtle differences in the information
    shown through different channels.  This is entirely unnecessary and
    cgroup v2 is dropping stat files which are duplicate from all
    controllers.  This patch removes "io.stat" from the root hierarchy.
