    cifs: don't spam the logs on unexpected lookup errors
    
    Andrey reported that he was seeing cifs.ko spam the logs with messages
    like this:
    
        CIFS VFS: Unexpected lookup error -26
    
    He was listing the root directory of a server and hitting an error when
    trying to QUERY_PATH_INFO against hiberfil.sys and pagefile.sys. The
    right fix would be to switch the lookup code over to using FIND_FIRST,
    but until then we really don't need to report this at a level of
    KERN_ERR. Convert this message over to FYI level.
