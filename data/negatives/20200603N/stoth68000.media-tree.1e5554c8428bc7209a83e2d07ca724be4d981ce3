    dm snapshot: iterate origin and cow devices
    
    Iterate both origin and snapshot devices
    
    iterate_devices method should call the callback for all the devices where
    the bio may be remapped. Thus, snapshot_iterate_devices should call the callback
    for both snapshot and origin underlying devices because it remaps some bios
    to the snapshot and some to the origin.
    
    snapshot_iterate_devices called the callback only for the origin device.
    This led to badly calculated device limits if snapshot and origin were placed
    on different types of disks.
