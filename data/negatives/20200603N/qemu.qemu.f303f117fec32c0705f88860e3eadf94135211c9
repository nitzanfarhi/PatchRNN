    spapr: ensure we have at least one XICS server
    
    XICS needs to know the upper value for cpu_index as it is used to compute
    the number of servers:
    
        smp_cpus * kvmppc_smt_threads() / smp_threads
    
    When passing -smp cpus=1,threads=9 on a POWER8 host, we end up with:
    
        1 * 8 / 9 = 0
    
    ... which leads to an assertion in both emulated:
    
    Number of servers needs to be greater 0
    Aborted (core dumped)
    
    ... and in-kernel XICS:
    
    xics_kvm_realize: Assertion `icp->nr_servers' failed.
    Aborted (core dumped)
    
    With this patch, we are sure that nr_servers > 0. Passing the same bogus
    -smp option then leads to:
    
    qemu-system-ppc64: Cannot support more than 8 threads on PPC with KVM
    
    ... which is a lot more explicit than the XICS errors.
