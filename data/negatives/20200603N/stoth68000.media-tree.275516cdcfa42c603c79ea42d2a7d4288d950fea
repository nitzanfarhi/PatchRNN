    Print IP address of unresponsive server
    
    Before this patch, only the hostname of the server
    is printed when it becomes unresponsive.
    This might not be helpful, if the IP-Address has
    changed since initial mount when the name was
    resolved (e.g. because the IPv6-Prefix changed).
    
    This patch adds the cached IP address of the unresponsive server,
    to the log message.
