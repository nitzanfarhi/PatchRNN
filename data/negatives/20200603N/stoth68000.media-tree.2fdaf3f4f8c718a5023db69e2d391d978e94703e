    iio:light:ltr501 bug in parameter sanity check.
    
    Clearly the intent was to error if the value was not 0 or 1.
    As implemented we have (A != 0 || A != 1) which is always true
    as A is never both 0 and 1 at the same time.
    
    As the autobuilder suggested, && makes more sense for this error
    check.
