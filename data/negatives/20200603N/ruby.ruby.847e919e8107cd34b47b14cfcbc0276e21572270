 	### When should you use DateTime and when should you use Time?
 
-	It's a common misconception that [William Shakespeare][1] and [Miguel de Cervantes][2] died on the same day in history - so much so that UNESCO named April 23 as [World Book Day because of this fact][3]. However because England hadn't yet adopted [Gregorian Calendar Reform][4] (and wouldn't until [1752][5]) their deaths are actually 10 days apart. Since Ruby's `Time` class implements a [proleptic Gregorian calendar][6] and has no concept of calendar reform then there's no way to express this. This is where `DateTime` steps in:

-	As you can see, if we're accurately tracking the number of [solar years][9] since Shakespeare's birthday then the correct anniversary date would be the 4th May and not the 23rd April.

-	So when should use you use `DateTime` in Ruby and when should you use `Time`? Almost certainly you'll want to use `Time` since your app is probably dealing with current dates and times. However, if you need to deal with dates and times in a historical context you'll want to use `DateTime` to avoid making the same mistakes as UNESCO. If you also have to deal with timezones then best of luck - just bear in mind that you'll probably be dealing with [local solar times][7], since it wasn't until the 19th century that the introduction of the railways necessitated the need for [Standard Time][8] and eventually timezones.
