    block, cfq: fix empty queue crash caused by request merge
    
    All requests of a queue could be merged to other requests of other queue.
    Such queue will not have request in it, but it's in service tree. This
    will cause kernel oops.
    I encounter a BUG_ON() in cfq_dispatch_request() with next patch, but the
    issue should exist without the patch.
