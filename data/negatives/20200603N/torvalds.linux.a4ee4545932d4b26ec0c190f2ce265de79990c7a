    PM / OPP: Don't support OPP if it provides supported-hw but platform does not
    
    The OPP framework allows each OPP to set a opp-supported-hw property
    which provides values that are matched against supported_hw values
    provided by the platform to limit support for certain OPPs on specific
    hardware. Currently, if the platform does not set supported_hw values,
    all OPPs are interpreted as supported, even if they have provided their
    own opp-supported-hw values.
    
    If an OPP has provided opp-supported-hw, it is indicating that there is
    some specific hardware configuration it is supported by. These constraints
    should be honored, and if no supported_hw has been provided by the
    platform, there is no way to determine if that OPP is actually supported,
    so it should be marked as not supported.
