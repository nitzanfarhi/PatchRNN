    clk: rockchip: rename rga clock-id on rk3399
    
    The rga clock supplying the working clock on the rk3399 is actually
    called rga-core in the manual. As the clock id has neither been
    assigned nor released with a full kernel release, we can still change
    the id to the more appropriate naming.
