    Revert "pinctrl: sunxi: Don't enforce bias disable (for now)"
    
    This reverts commit 2154d94b40ea2a5de05245521371d0461bb0d669.
    
    The original patch was intented to avoid some issues with the sunxi
    gpio rework and was supposed to be reverted after all the required
    DT bits had been merged around v4.10.
