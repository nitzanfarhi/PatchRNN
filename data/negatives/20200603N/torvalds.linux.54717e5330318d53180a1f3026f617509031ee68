    ath9k_hw: do not load noise floor readings when it is running
    
    Noise floor calibration is performed on longcal interval and
    the reading will be updated in history buffer. On rare occasions,
    the previous noisefloor calibration might not be completed within
    the period and trying to load nf reading will be failed. In such
    situation, postpone the nf cabliration to next cycle to give
    enough time to complete the calibration. This was already taken
    care for ar9002 chips.
