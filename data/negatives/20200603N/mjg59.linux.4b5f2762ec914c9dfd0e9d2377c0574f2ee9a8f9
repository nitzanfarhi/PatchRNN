    UBIFS: improve statfs reporting
    
    Make free space calculation less pessimistic and more realistic,
    which in turn improves 'statfs()' reports. Now it lies by 10%-20%,
    instead of 20%-30% (10% more honest).
    
    Results of "freespace" test (120MiB volume, 16KiB LEB size,
    512 bytes page size). Before the change:
