    That array only needs 16 elements.
    
    No need for a 17th null terminator.
    
    This might, or might not, give Coverity a clue that
    
            u_char *p;
    
            hex[*p >> 4]
            hex[*p & 0xf]
    
    are both safe, no matter how "tainted" p is, because if you shift an
    8-bit unsigned value right 4 bits, the result is between 0 and 15.  (See
    CID 1206732.)
