commit 392a1ce761bc3b3a5d642ee341c1ff082cbb71f0

    [PATCH] PCI Error Recovery: header file patch
    
    Various PCI bus errors can be signaled by newer PCI controllers.
    Recovering from those errors requires an infrastructure to notify
    affected device drivers of the error, and a way of walking through a
    reset sequence.  This patch adds a set of callbacks to be used by error
    recovery routines to notify device drivers of the various stages of
    recovery.
