    df: Skip final '/' character when calculating basename.
    
    Previously it was including the final '/' character when calculating
    the basename for the -a option eg:
    
    Filesystem                                Size       Used  Available  Use%
    /Ubuntu1010x64:/dev/sda1                  9.4G       2.3G       6.6G   25%
    
    With this patch the '/' is not printed.
