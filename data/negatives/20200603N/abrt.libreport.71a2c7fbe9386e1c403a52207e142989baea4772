    mailx: stop creating dead.letter on mailx failures
    
    SELinux does not like mailx creating the file and I do not see any
    reason to create the file in a problem directory because the file
    contains a copy of the email that could not be send.
    
    Failures of EVENT=notify are discoverable in system logs and if you run
    the reporter manually, you will see that mailx failed.
