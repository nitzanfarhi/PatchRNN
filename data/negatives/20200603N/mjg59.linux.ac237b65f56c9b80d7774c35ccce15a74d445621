    powerpc: Enable /dev/port when isa_io_special is set
    
    isa_io_special is set when the platform provides a "special"
    implementation of inX/outX via some FW interface for example.
    
    Such a platform doesn't need an ISA bridge on PCI, and so /dev/port
    should be made available even if one isn't present.
    
    This makes the LPC bus IOs accessible via /dev/port on PowerNV Power8
