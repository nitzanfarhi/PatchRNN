    Fix requiredFeature stage handling logic
    
    Originally the way Jonathan had written this was correct in
    "continue"ing:
    
    https://github.com/jfkthame/harfbuzz/commit/35e28c7a733eaffcd9f062b18d7db9fbb3d990fc#diff-ead86a33a5cc9ad7f6e6381031a0baddR199
    
    When I rewrote his patch, I messed it up:
    
    https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/commit/da132937989acb4d8ca9bd41c79f98750e7dda30#diff-ead86a33a5cc9ad7f6e6381031a0baddR209
    
    the intended behavior was NOT to set found=TRUE and NOT to continue.
    This was resulting in feature_index[table_index] being left unset.
    Oops!
