    logind: prefer new sessions over older ones on VT switches
    
    Our seat->positions[] array keeps track of the 'preferred' session on a
    VT. The only situation this is used, is to select the session to activate
    when a VT is activated. In the normal case, there's only one session per
    VT so the selection is trivial.
    
    Older greeters, however, implement take-overs when they start sessions on
    the same VT that the greeter ran on. We recently limited such take-overs
    to VTs where a greeter is running on, to force people to never share VTs
    in new code that is written.
    
    For legacy reasons, we need to be compatible to old greeters, though.
    Hence, we allow those greeters to implement take-over. In such take-overs,
    however, we should really make sure that the new sessions gets preferred
    over the old one under all circumstances. Hence, make sure we override
    the previous preferred session with a new session.
