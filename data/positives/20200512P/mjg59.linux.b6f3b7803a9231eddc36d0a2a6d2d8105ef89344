    genirq: NULL struct irq_desc's member 'name' in dynamic_irq_cleanup()
    
    If the member 'name' of the irq_desc structure happens to point to a
    character string that is resident within a kernel module, problems ensue
    if that module is rmmod'd (at which time dynamic_irq_cleanup() is called)
    and then later show_interrupts() is called by someone.
    
    It is also not a good thing if the character string resided in kmalloc'd
    space that has been kfree'd (after having called dynamic_irq_cleanup()).
    dynamic_irq_cleanup() fails to NULL the 'name' member and
    show_interrupts() references it on a few architectures (like h8300, sh and
    x86).
