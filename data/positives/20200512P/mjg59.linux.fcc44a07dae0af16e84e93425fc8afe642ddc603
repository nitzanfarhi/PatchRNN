    mtd: lart: initialize writebufsize
    
    The writebufsize concept was introduce by commit
    "0e4ca7e mtd: add writebufsize field to mtd_info struct" and it represents
    the maximum amount of data the device writes to the media at a time. This is
    an important parameter for UBIFS which is used during recovery and which
    basically defines how big a corruption caused by a power cut can be.
    
    Set writebufsize to 4 because this drivers writes at max 4 bytes at a time.
