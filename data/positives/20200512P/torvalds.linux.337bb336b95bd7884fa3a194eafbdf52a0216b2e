    ALSA: atmel_abdac: clk_round_rate() can return a zero upon error
    
    Treat both negative and zero return values from clk_round_rate()
    as errors.  This is needed since subsequent patches will convert
    clk_round_rate()'s return value to be an unsigned type, rather
    than a signed type, since some clock sources can generate rates higher
    than (2^31)-1 Hz.
    
    Eventually, when calling clk_round_rate(), only a return value of
    zero will be considered a error; all other values will be
    considered valid rates.  The comparison against values less than
    0 is kept to preserve the correct behavior in the meantime.
