    bdi: register sysfs bdi device only once per queue
    
    Devices which share the same queue, like floppies and mtd devices, get
    registered multiple times in the bdi interface, but bdi accounts only the
    last registered device of the devices sharing one queue.
    
    On remove, all earlier registered devices leak, stay around in sysfs, and
    cause "duplicate filename" errors if the devices are re-created.
    
    This prevents the creation of multiple bdi interfaces per queue, and the
    bdi device will carry the dev_t name of the block device which is the
    first one registered, of the pool of devices using the same queue.
