    powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak to userspace via BHRB buffer
    
    The current Branch History Rolling Buffer (BHRB) code does not check
    for any privilege levels before updating the data from BHRB. This
    could leak kernel addresses to userspace even when profiling only with
    userspace privileges. Add proper checks to prevent it.
