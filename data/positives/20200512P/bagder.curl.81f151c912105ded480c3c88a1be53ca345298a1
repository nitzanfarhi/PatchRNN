    header_callback: strip off file path separated with backslashes
    
    If the filename contains a backslash, only use filename portion. The
    idea is that even systems that don't handle backslashes as path
    separators probably want that path removed for convenience.
    
    This flaw is considered a security problem, see the curl security
    vulnerability http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20101013.html
