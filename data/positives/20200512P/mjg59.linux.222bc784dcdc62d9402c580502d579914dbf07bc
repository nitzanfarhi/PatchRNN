    mfd: wm8994: Silence bogus warning in wm8994_device_init()
    
    'patch_regs' cannot be used uninitialized in wm8994_device_init(),
    because 'patch_regs' was already guarded by 'regmap_patch'.
    Thus, that's a bogus warning.
    
    Without this patch, the build warning happens as below:
    
    drivers/mfd/wm8994-core.c: In function 'wm8994_i2c_probe':
    drivers/mfd/wm8994-core.c:595:7: warning: 'patch_regs' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
    drivers/mfd/wm8994-core.c:408:14: note: 'patch_regs' was declared here
