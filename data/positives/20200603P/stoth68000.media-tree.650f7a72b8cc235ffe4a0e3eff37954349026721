    ARM: OMAP1: Fix reprogramming of DPLL1 for systems that boot at rates below 60MHz
    
    Commit e9b7086b80c4d9e354f4edc9e280ae85a60df408 (ARM: OMAP: Fix
    reprogramming of dpll1 rate) fixed a regression for systems that
    did not rely on bootloader set rates.
    
    However, it also introduced a new problem where the rates selected
    in .config would not take affect as omap1_select_table_rate
    currently refuses to reprogram DPLL1 if it's already initialized.
    
    This was not a problem earlier, as the reprogramming was done
    earlier with ck_dpll1_p->rate uninitialized.
    
    Fix this by forcing the reprogramming on systems booting at rates
    below 60MHz. Note that the long term fix is to make the rates
    SoC specific later on.
    
    Thanks for Janusz Krzysztofik <jkrzyszt@tis.icnet.pl> for figuring
    this one out.
