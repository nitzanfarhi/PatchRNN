    V4L/DVB (7729): Fix VIDIOCGAP corruption in ivtv
    
    Frank Bennett reported that ivtv was causing skype to crash. With help
    from one of their developers he showed it was a kernel problem.
    VIDIOCGCAP copies a name into a fixed length buffer - ivtv uses names
    that are too long and does not truncate them so corrupts a few bytes of
    the app data area.
    
    Possibly the names also want trimming but for now this should fix the
    corruption case.
