    mm: vmpressure: fix sending wrong events on underflow
    
    At the end of a window period, if the reclaimed pages is greater than
    scanned, an unsigned underflow can result in a huge pressure value and
    thus a critical event.  Reclaimed pages is found to go higher than
    scanned because of the addition of reclaimed slab pages to reclaimed in
    shrink_node without a corresponding increment to scanned pages.
    
    Minchan Kim mentioned that this can also happen in the case of a THP
    page where the scanned is 1 and reclaimed could be 512.
