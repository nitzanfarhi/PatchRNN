    [NETFILTER]: nfnetlink_queue: fix computation of allocated size for netlink skb.
    
    Size of the netlink skb was wrongly computed because the formula was using
    NLMSG_ALIGN instead of NLMSG_SPACE. NLMSG_ALIGN does not add the room for
    netlink header as NLMSG_SPACE does. This was causing a failure of message
    building in some cases.
    
    On my test system, all messages for packets in range [8*k+41, 8*k+48] where k
    is an integer were invalid and the corresponding packets were dropped.
