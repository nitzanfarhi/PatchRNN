commit 1e7acbb7bc1ae7c1c62fd1310b3176a820225056

    xfs: silence uninitialised f.file warning.
    
    Uninitialised variable build warning introduced by 2903ff0 ("switch
    simple cases of fget_light to fdget"), gcc is not smart enough to
    work out that the variable is not used uninitialised, and the commit
    removed the initialisation at declaration that the old variable had.
