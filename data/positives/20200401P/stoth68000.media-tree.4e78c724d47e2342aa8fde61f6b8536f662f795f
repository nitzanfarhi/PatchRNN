    TOMOYO: Fix oops in tomoyo_mount_acl().
    
    In tomoyo_mount_acl() since 2.6.36, kern_path() was called without checking
    dev_name != NULL. As a result, an unprivileged user can trigger oops by issuing
    mount(NULL, "/", "ext3", 0, NULL) request.
    Fix this by checking dev_name != NULL before calling kern_path(dev_name).
