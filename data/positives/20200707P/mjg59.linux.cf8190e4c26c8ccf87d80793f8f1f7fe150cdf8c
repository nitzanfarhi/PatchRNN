    hv_netvsc: Fix race condition on Multi-Send Data field
    
    In commit 2a04ae8acb14 ("hv_netvsc: remove locking in netvsc_send()"), the
    locking for MSD (Multi-Send Data) field was removed. This could cause a
    race condition between RNDIS control messages and data packets processing,
    because these two types of traffic are not synchronized.
    This patch fixes this issue by sending control messages out directly
    without reading MSD field.
