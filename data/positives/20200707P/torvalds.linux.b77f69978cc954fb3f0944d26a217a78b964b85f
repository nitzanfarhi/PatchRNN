    drm/i915: Avoid NULL ctx->obj dereference in debugfs/i915_context_info

        drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.
    
    we populated fake contexts on all platforms. These were identical to the
    full hardware context tracking structs, except for the ctx->obj used to
    store the hardware state. However, there remained one place where we
    assumed that if a context existed, it would have an object associated
    with it.
