    drm/i915/gen9: Initialize intel_state->active_crtcs during WM sanitization (v2)
    
    intel_state->active_crtcs is usually only initialized when doing a
    modeset.  During our first atomic commit after boot, we're effectively
    faking a modeset to sanitize the DDB/wm setup, so ensure that this field
    gets initialized before use.
    
    v2:
     - Don't clobber active_crtcs if our first commit really is a modeset
       (Maarten)
     - Grab connection_mutex when faking a modeset during sanitization
       (Maarten)
