    perf: Initialize callchains roots's childen hits
    
    Each histogram entry has a callchain root that stores the
    callchain samples. However we forgot to initialize the
    tracking of children hits of these roots, which then got
    random values on their creation.
    
    The root children hits is multiplied by the minimum percentage
    of hits provided by the user, and the result becomes the minimum
    hits expected from children branches. If the random value due
    to the uninitialization is big enough, then this minimum number
    of hits can be huge and eventually filter every children branches.
    
    The end result was invisible callchains. All we need to
    fix this is to initialize the children hits of the root.
