    netfilter: ctnetlink: don't add null bindings if no nat requested
    
    commit 0eba801b64cc8284d9024c7ece30415a2b981a72 tried to fix a race
    where nat initialisation can happen after ctnetlink-created conntrack
    has been created.
    
    However, it causes the nat module(s) to be loaded needlessly on
    systems that are not using NAT.
    
    Fortunately, we do not have to create null bindings in that case.
    
    conntracks injected via ctnetlink always have the CONFIRMED bit set,
    which prevents addition of the nat extension in nf_nat_ipv4/6_fn().
    
    We only need to make sure that either no nat extension is added
    or that we've created both src and dst manips.
