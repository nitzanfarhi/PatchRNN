    net: fix incorrect credentials passing
    
    Commit 257b5358b32f ("scm: Capture the full credentials of the scm
    sender") changed the credentials passing code to pass in the effective
    uid/gid instead of the real uid/gid.
    
    Obviously this doesn't matter most of the time (since normally they are
    the same), but it results in differences for suid binaries when the wrong
    uid/gid ends up being used.
    
    This just undoes that (presumably unintentional) part of the commit.
