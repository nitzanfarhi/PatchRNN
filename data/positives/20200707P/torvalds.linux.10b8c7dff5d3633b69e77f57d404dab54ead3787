    fs/cifs/cifs_dfs_ref.c: fix potential memory leakage
    
    When it goes to error through line 144, the memory allocated to *devname is
    not freed, and the caller doesn't free it either in line 250. So we free the
    memroy of *devname in function cifs_compose_mount_options() when it goes to
    error.
