    ftrace: allow NULL pointers in mcount_loc
    
    Impact: make ftrace_convert_nops() more permissive
    
    Due to the way different architecture linkers combine the data sections
    of the mcount_loc (the section that lists all the locations that
    call mcount), there may be zeros added in that section. This is usually
    due to strange alignments that the linker performs, that pads in zeros.
    
    This patch makes the conversion code to nops skip any pointer in
    the mcount_loc section that is NULL.
