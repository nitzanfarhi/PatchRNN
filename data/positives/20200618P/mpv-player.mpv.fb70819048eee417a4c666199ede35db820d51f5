    vo_opengl: don't upload potentially uninitialized memory to GL buffer
    
    If the texture count is lower than 4, entries in va.textcoord[] will
    remain uninitialized. While this is unlikely to be a problem (since
    these values are unused on the shader side too), it's not nice and might
    explain some things which have shown up in valgrind.
    
    Fix by always initializing the whole thing.
