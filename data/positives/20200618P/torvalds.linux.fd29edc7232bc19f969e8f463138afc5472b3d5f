    staging: speakup: Replace strncpy with memcpy
    
    gcc 8.1.0 generates the following warnings.
    
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c: In function 'punc_store':
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:522:2: warning:
            'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul
            copying as many bytes from a string as its length
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:504:6: note: length computed here
    
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c: In function 'synth_store':
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:391:2: warning:
            'strncpy' output truncated before terminating nul
            copying as many bytes from a string as its length
    drivers/staging/speakup/kobjects.c:388:8: note: length computed here
    
    Using strncpy() is indeed less than perfect since the length of data to
    be copied has already been determined with strlen(). Replace strncpy()
    with memcpy() to address the warning and optimize the code a little.
