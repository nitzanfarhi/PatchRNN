    nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment constructor during recovery
    
    According to a report from Yuxuan Shui, nilfs2 in kernel 3.19 got stuck
    during recovery at mount time.  The code path that caused the deadlock was
    as follows:
    
      nilfs_fill_super()
        load_nilfs()
          nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs()
            * Do roll-forwarding, attach segment constructor for recovery,
              and kick it.
    
            nilfs_segctor_thread()
              nilfs_segctor_thread_construct()
               * A lock is held with nilfs_transaction_lock()
                 nilfs_segctor_do_construct()
                   nilfs_segctor_drop_written_files()
                     iput()
                       iput_final()
                         write_inode_now()
                           writeback_single_inode()
                             __writeback_single_inode()
                               do_writepages()
                                 nilfs_writepage()
                                   nilfs_construct_dsync_segment()
                                     nilfs_transaction_lock() --> deadlock
    
    This can happen if commit 7ef3ff2fea8b ("nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment
    constructor over I_SYNC flag") is applied and roll-forward recovery was
    performed at mount time.  The roll-forward recovery can happen if datasync
    write is done and the file system crashes immediately after that.  For
    instance, we can reproduce the issue with the following steps:
    
     < nilfs2 is mounted on /nilfs (device: /dev/sdb1) >
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test bs=4k count=1 && sync
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test conv=notrunc oflag=dsync bs=4k
     count=1 && reboot -nfh
     < the system will immediately reboot >
     # mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sdb1 /nilfs
    
    The deadlock occurs because iput() can run segment constructor through
    writeback_single_inode() if MS_ACTIVE flag is not set on sb->s_flags.  The
    above commit changed segment constructor so that it calls iput()
    asynchronously for inodes with i_nlink == 0, but that change was
    imperfect.
    
    This fixes the another deadlock by deferring iput() in segment constructor
    even for the case that mount is not finished, that is, for the case that
    MS_ACTIVE flag is not set.
