    nfsd4: fix security flavor of NFSv4.0 callback
    
    Commit d5497fc693a446ce9100fcf4117c3f795ddfd0d2 "nfsd4: move rq_flavor
    into svc_cred" forgot to remove cl_flavor from the client, leaving two
    places (cl_flavor and cl_cred.cr_flavor) for the flavor to be stored.
    After that patch, the latter was the one that was updated, but the
    former was the one that the callback used.
    
    Symptoms were a long delay on utime().  This is because the utime()
    generated a setattr which recalled a delegation, but the cb_recall was
    ignored by the client because it had the wrong security flavor.
