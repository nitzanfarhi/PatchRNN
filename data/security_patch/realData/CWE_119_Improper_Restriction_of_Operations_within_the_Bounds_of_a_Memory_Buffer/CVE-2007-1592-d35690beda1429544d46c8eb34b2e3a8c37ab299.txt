Subject: [IPV6]: ipv6_fl_socklist is inadvertently shared.

The ipv6_fl_socklist from listening socket is inadvertently shared
with new socket created for connection.  This leads to a variety of
interesting, but fatal, bugs. For example, removing one of the
sockets may lead to the other socket's encountering a page fault
when the now freed list is referenced.

The fix is to not share the flow label list with the new socket.
