Subject: Make sure device paths are quoted

in the case a vfat removable device has $() or `` in its label,
such as $(touch foo) the quoted command may get executed,
leaving an attack vector. Use KMacroExpander::expandMacrosShellQuote
to make sure everything is quoted and not interpreted as a command
