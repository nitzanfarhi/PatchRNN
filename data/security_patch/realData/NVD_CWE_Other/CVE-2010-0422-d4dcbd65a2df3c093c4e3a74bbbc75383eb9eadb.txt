Subject: [PATCH] Update which monitor the unlock dialog is on when layout
 changes

Before we were moving the grabs but not the unlock dialog.
Everything needs to be in lock step, otherwise:

1) The unlock dialog won't get focus and will fail to work generally
2) Assumptions in the code about the two being in lock-step will
prove incorrect leading to the grabs getting dropped entirely.

Part of fix for
