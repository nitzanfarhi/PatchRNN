Subject: sctp: Do not reset the packet during sctp_packet_config().

sctp_packet_config() is called when getting the packet ready
for appending of chunks.  The function should not touch the
current state, since it's possible to ping-pong between two
transports when sending, and that can result packet corruption
followed by skb overlfow crash.
